        <p class="para">Independence Day is annually celebrated on 15 August, as a national holiday in
            India.Independence Day is a
            special day for the Indians, because on this day India enjoys freedom from the British rule since
            the years of slavery.</p>
        <p class="parasf">Due to the non-violence movement of Mahatma Gandhi, since 200 years of long struggle, our
            freedom fighters
            got a lot
            from the British Empire and after Independence Strong struggle for independence used to act as a catalyst,
            who had done
            every Indian together for his rights against British rule, even if he wanted to follow any religion, class,
            caste,
            culture or tradition. Even women like Aruna Asif Ali, Annie Besant, Kamala Nehru, Sarojini Naidu and Vijay
            Lakshmi
            Pandit have left their role in the fight for independence, leaving chaos.</p>
        <p class="parasfx">India is a country where millions of people live together in different religions, traditions
            and culture, and celebrate
            this celebration of Independence with full happiness. On this day, being an Indian, we should be proud and
            promise that
            we will be completely and honest with all patriotism to protect our motherland from any kind of attack or
            insult.
